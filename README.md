  # BikeShare-App
  In this project I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I build a script to import data and answer question by computing descriptive statistics of data, and create interactive experience in terminal to present these statistics.<br>
  ### Main functions:<br>
      1-	Load data: loads dataset.<br>
      2-	Get filter: Asks user to specify a city, month, and day to analyze.<br>
      3-	Time stats: Displays statistics on the most frequent times of travel.<br>
      4-	Station stats: Displays statistics on the most popular stations and trip.<br>
      5-	User stats: Displays statistics on bike share users.<br>
      6-	Display row data: Displays data head request.<br>
